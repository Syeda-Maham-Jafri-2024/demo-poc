 I evaluated the patient today for an ERCP due to her persistent abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated liver enzymes. Her ultrasound showed some mild duct dilation and there is a concern for possible obstruction or stones. Given her history of gallstones, I decided to proceed with further imaging. A CT scan confirmed the duct dilation but didn't show any masses. She is stable overall but she is on anticoagulants so we have adjusted her medication and are monitoring her anticoagulation profile closely. I have also checked her kidney function since we will be using contrast dye. After discussing the risks, the patient is aware of the potential complications including pancreatitis and infection. The next step is to prepare her for the ERCP and will monitor her condition closely leading up to the procedure. Bye.
